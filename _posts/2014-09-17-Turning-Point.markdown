I set up my blog using GitHub & Jekyll in September. 2014.
I had been installed many blogs like WordPress, however, no one is used in these days.
I just focused on appearance of blog and did not concentrated on writing posts.
In this time, I want to make a change that writing posts first and appearance later.

Topics that I want to cover are follows.

*. Machine Learning
: Machine learning is the most hot area in computer science in these days.
: I want to read [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning] written by [Christopher M. Bishop].
: I will (if I could) summary the book and writing posts steadily.

*. Collaborative Teaching Project
: Open Lectures are provieded by coursera, edX, c<>deSchool, and etc.
: However, I feel that we need a system which can interact with others to discuss through internet to help understand well.
: Role model for this project is [slack].

*. Programming Techniques
: To share or archive, some posts will be useful techniques for programming.


One year later, I hope about 40 posts are registered by myself!
